# flight_prices_prediction

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts flight prices using a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Users can input flight details such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, travel class, and days left until the journey. The app leverages machine learning to provide instant price estimates, making it easy for travelers to plan their trips.

The app is built with Python, Streamlit for the UI, and TensorFlow for the neural network model. It uses a pickled pipeline and dataset for seamless predictions.


## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app features an intuitive layout with dropdown menus for selecting airlines, cities, and times, along with a slider for adjusting days left. This makes it accessible for non-technical users to get accurate price predictions without hassle. (Highlighted feature as per your request.)
- Instant Price Prediction: Enter flight details and get an estimated price in seconds using a trained ANN model.
- Data-Driven: Supports a wide range of airlines, cities, and travel classes based on the included dataset.
- Cross-Platform: Runs easily on any machine with Python and Streamlit installed.
